    <!-- Q1 => Write a simple program in HTML that displays the heading "HTML defines the content
               and structure of your website” on the web browser?  -->
    <!-- Ans => -->
    <h1>HTML defines the content and structure of your website</h1>

    <!-- Q2 => Explain the purpose of comments in HTML and provide an example of how to use comments in an HTML document? 

    Ans => Comments in HTML are used to insert notes or explanations within the code that are not visible to the end user when the webpage is rendered by a browser. These comments are often helpful for developers to leave reminders, explain complex code, or temporarily disable sections of the code without deleting them.

    Purpose of Comments in HTML:

    Documentation: To explain the purpose of certain sections of code.
    Collaboration: To leave notes for other developers who may work on the same project.
    Debugging: To hide code temporarily without deleting it, allowing for easy reactivation later.
    Organizing Code: To divide sections of an HTML document for better readability.

    This answer is itself an example.

    <!-- Q3 => Write an HTML program that includes a heading, a paragraph of text, a
    horizontal line, and a line break. Arrange these elements to create a simple web
    page layout? -->

    <!-- Heading of the webpage -->
    <h1>Hello World</h1>

    <!-- Paragraph of text -->
    <p>
      This is a paragraph that gives a brief introduction to the page layout.
    </p>

    <!-- Horizontal line to separate sections -->
    <hr />

    <!-- Another paragraph with a line break -->
    <p>
      This is another paragraph of text.<br />
      Here is a new line after the break tag.
    </p>

    <!-- Q4 => Write a short note on Tag and element with an example?  -->

    <!-- Tag => 
    A tag is the basic building block of HTML that is used to define
    elements. Tags typically come in pairs: an opening tag and a closing tag.
    The opening tag contains the name of the element, enclosed in angle brackets
    (e.g.,
    <p>
      ), and the closing tag is the same, but with a forward slash before the
      element name (e.g.,
    </p>
    ). Some tags, like <img /> or <br />, are self-closing. 
    
    Element =>    
    An element refers to the complete structure, which includes the opening tag, the
    content inside, and the closing tag. In HTML, elements represent the actual
    content or the structure you want to display on the web page.


    Example : 

    <p> is the opening tag.
    </p> is the closing tag.
    <p>This is an HTML paragraph.</p> is the entire element, consisting of the tags and the content in between.

    Another example with a self-closing tag:
   <img src="image.jpg" alt="Sample Image"> -->

    <!-- Q5 => What is the DOCTYPE Declaration in HTML? -->

    <!-- Ans => The DOCTYPE declaration in HTML is a special instruction that tells the web browser what version of HTML the page is written in. It helps the browser render the page correctly by understanding how to interpret the document. The DOCTYPE is always placed at the very beginning of an HTML document, before the <html> tag.

   Purpose of DOCTYPE Declaration:

   Standards Mode: It ensures that the browser renders the page in standards mode, following the official HTML specifications, rather than in quirks mode, which mimics older browsers with outdated behaviors.
   Compatibility: It helps maintain compatibility across different browsers and platforms by ensuring that all browsers interpret the HTML consistently.
   DOCTYPE in HTML5:
   In HTML5, the DOCTYPE declaration is very simple and does not reference a specific version of HTML, as HTML5 is designed to be backward-compatible. -->
